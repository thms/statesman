## Technical Capabilities

Based on the provided codebase, the following technical capabilities are evident:

* **Data Storage:** The codebase utilizes `ActiveRecord` and `Mongoid` for data persistence, indicating the use of relational and document-oriented databases.
* **Process Automation:** The codebase includes features for managing state transitions, suggesting the implementation of automated workflows.
* **Document Storage:** The codebase handles metadata serialization using JSON, implying the ability to store and retrieve structured data.
* **Data Analytics:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the codebase's focus on state management and data persistence suggests potential for data analysis and reporting.

**Note:** The codebase does not explicitly demonstrate capabilities like `Event Streaming`, `Observability`, `CI/CD`, `Distributed Tracing`, `Service mesh`, `Database Backup`, `Infrastructure as Code`, or `Digital Signatures`.
