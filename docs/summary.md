The codebase implements a state machine library called Statesman. It provides a way to define states and transitions between them for Ruby objects. Statesman allows you to define events that trigger transitions, and it supports guards and callbacks to control the transition process. It also provides adapters for different storage mechanisms, including ActiveRecord, Mongoid, and in-memory storage. The library includes features like `transition_to!` and `trigger!` to move an object between states, and methods like `current_state` and `allowed_transitions` to query the state machine.
