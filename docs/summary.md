The codebase implements a state machine library called Statesman, which allows developers to define and manage state transitions for objects in their applications. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for defining states, transitions, and associated callbacks. Statesman supports different storage adapters, including in-memory, ActiveRecord, and Mongoid, allowing users to choose the most suitable option for their needs. The library includes features like defining initial states, specifying transitions between states, and executing callbacks before, after, and after commit of transitions. It also provides methods for checking allowed transitions, retrieving transition history, and triggering events that cause state transitions.
